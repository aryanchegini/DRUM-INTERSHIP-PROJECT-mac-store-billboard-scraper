# mac-store-billboard-scraper
A Python script that takes the postcodes of billboards around the UK from an Excel file, inserts them into the M.A.C store finder on the M.A.C Cosmetics website, and scrapes the address of the nearest M.A.C store, adding them in a new column in the spreadsheet.

Makes use of headless chrome.
